msgid "PHP is a server-side language, and monitoring blockchains using WebSockets with PHP is a fairly rare pattern, so here we will show you how to implement it on the front end using javascript. We will introduce how to implement it on the front end using javascript. The following is based on SymbolV3 for quick learning. The listener in v2 is a function dependent on rxjs, so v3 does not have a listener function. Therefore, implementers need to program WebSocket clients."
