msgid "Symbol does not need to create a new account when setting up a multisig. Instead co-signatories can be specified for an existing account. Creating a multisig account requires the consent signature (opt-in) of the account designated as the co-signatory. Aggregate Transactions are used to confirm this."

msgid "It shows that cosignatoryAddresses are registered as co-signatories. Also, minApproval:3 shows that the number of signatures required for a transaction to execute is 3. minRemoval: 3 shows that the number of signatories required to remove a cosignatory is 3."

msgid "In the case of Aggregate Complete Transaction, the transaction is created after collecting all the signatures of the cosignatories before announcing it to the nodes."

msgid "Aggregate bonded transactions can be announced without specifying co-signatories. It is completed by declaring that the transaction will be pre-stored with a hash lock, and the co-signer additionally signs the transaction once it has been stored on the network."

msgid "When a bonded transaction is known by a node, it will be a partial signature state and will be signed with a multisig account, using the co-signature introduced in chapter 8. Locking. It can also be confirmed by a wallet that supports co-signatures."

msgid "To reduce the number of co-signatories, specify the address to remove and adjust the number of co-signatories so that the minimum number of signatories is not exceeded and then announce the transaction. It is not necessary to include the account subject to remove as a co-signatory."

msgid "The management of private keys can be distributed across multiple terminals. Multisigs can be used to ensure safe recovery in the event of a lost or compromised key. If the key is lost then the user can access funds through co-signatories and if stolen then the attacker cannot transfer funds without cosignatory approval."

msgid "The private key of a multisig account is deactivated and unless the multisig is removed on the account sending mosaics will no longer be possible. As explained in Chapter 5. Mosaics, possession is â€œthe state of being able to give it up at will', it can be said the owner of the assets on a multisig account are the co-signatories. Symbol allows replacement of co-signatories in a multisig configuration, so account ownership can be securely replaceable to another co-signatory."
msgstr ""

msgid "Symbol allows you to configure up to 3 levels of multisig (multi-level multisig). The use of multi-level multisig accounts prevents the use of stolen backup keys to complete a multisig, or the use of only an approver and an auditor to complete a signature. This allows the existence of transactions on the blockchain to be presented as evidence that certain operations and conditions have been met."
