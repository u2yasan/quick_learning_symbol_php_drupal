msgid "Unlike Bonded Transactions, there is no need to pay fees (10XYM) for hashlocks. If the payload can be shared, the seller can create payloads for all possible potential buyers and wait for negotiations to start. (Exclusion control should be used, e.g. by mixing only one existing receipt NFT into the Aggregate Transaction, so that multiple transactions are not executed separately). There is no need to build a dedicated marketplace for these negotiations. Users can use a social networking timeline as a marketplace, or develop a one-time marketplace at any time or in any space as required."
