msgid "Key-Value format data can be registered for an account mosaic namespace. The maximum value of data that can be written is 1024 bytes. We make the assumption that both mosaic, namespace and account are created by Alice in this chapter."

msgid "While metadata has the advantage of providing quick access to information by Key-Value, it should be noted that it needs updating. Updating requires the signatures of the issuer account and the account to which it is registered, so it should only be used if both accounts can be trusted."

msgid "We described proof of ownership in the Mosaic chapter and domain linking in the Namespace chapter. By receiving metadata issued by an account linked from a reliable domain can be used for proofing of ownership of eligibility within that domain."

msgid "The ecosystem is divided into issuers, owners and verifiers, e.g. students own the diplomas issued by universities, and companies verify the certificates presented by the students based on the public keys published by the universities. There is no platform-dependent or third party-dependent information required for this verification. By utilising metadata in this way, universities can issue metadata to accounts owned by students, and companies can verify the proof of graduation listed in the metadata with the university's public key and the student's mosaic (account) proof of ownership."
