msgid "Verify all kinds of information recorded on the blockchain. While recording data on the blockchain is done with the agreement of all nodes, referencing data on the blockchain is achieved by obtaining information from a single node. For this reason, to avoid making a new transaction based on information from an untrusted node, the data obtained from the node must be verified."

msgid "The hash value of the transaction does not contain information about the co-signatory. On the other hand, the Merkle root stored in the block header contains a hash of the transaction with the information of the co-signatory included. Therefore, when verifying whether a transaction exists inside a block, the transaction hash must be converted to a Merkle component hash."

msgstr ""

msgid "What the verification methods in this chapter shows is that all information held by the blockchain can be verified by the hash value of the block header. Blockchains are based on the sharing of block headers that everyone agrees upon and the existence of full nodes that can reproduce them. However, it is challenging to maintain an environment to verify these in every situation where you want to utilise the blockchain."
msgstr ""

msgid "If the latest block headers are constantly broadcast from multiple trusted institutions, this can greatly reduce the need for verification. Such an infrastructure would allow access to trusted information even in places beyond the capabilities of the blockchain, such as urban areas where tens of millions of people are densely populated, or in remote areas where base stations cannot be adequately deployed, or during wide-area network outages during disasters."
