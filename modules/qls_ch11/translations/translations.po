msgid ""Account restriction" and "Mosaic Global Restriction" features can be used to control the properties of Symbol accounts and mosaics. The flexibility of restrictions has the potential to fulfil practical use cases of the Symbol blockchain in real-world situations. For example, it could be necessary to place limitations on the transfer of a specific mosaic to comply with laws and regulations or to avoid specific tokens issued by a business from being traded. Accounts can also be limited to restrict incoming transactions of certain mosaics or from specific users to avoid spam or malicious transactions providing additional safety to Symbol users."
